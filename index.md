I am a historian and digital humanist. I work as a Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In this role I support and collaborate with students and faculty who seek to engage digital methods in their teaching, research, or learning. My areas of expertise are digital mapping, audio storytelling, and web exhibits, though I also dabble in data mining, network analysis, and some artisanal coding in Python and JavaScript. My main area of research is the history of data in American advertising, from the earliest days of the ad industry in the 1850s to the rise of the internet.

I am the lead producer of a the ten-part documentary podcast [*Stories from the Epicenter*](https://library.ucsc.edu/StoriesFromTheEpicenter), which explores the expeience and memory of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in Santa Cruz County, California.

I currently serve as a consulting editor for *The American Historical Review* and produce the journal's podcast, [*AHR Interview*](https://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/ahrinterview).

I hold a PhD in History from Indiana University, Bloomington, where I also earned a Graduate Certificate in Digital Arts and Humanities, and an MA in the Social Sciences from the University of Chicago.
