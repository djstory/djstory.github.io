I am a historian and digital humanist. I work as a Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In this role I support and collaborate with students and faculty who seek to engage digital methods in their teaching, research, or learning. My areas of expertise are digital mapping, audio storytelling, and web exhibits, though I also do work in text mining and network analysis.

I am the lead producer of the ten-part documentary podcast [*Stories from the Epicenter*](https://library.ucsc.edu/StoriesFromTheEpicenter), which explores the experience and memory of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in Santa Cruz County, California.

I serve as a Consulting Editor for the *American Historical Review* and produce the journal's podcast, [*History in Focus*](https://www.historians.org/history-in-focus).

I have an ongoing research interest in the American advertising industry's collection and use of consumer data, from the industry's earliest days in the mid-nineetenth century to the rise of the World Wide Web.

I hold a PhD in History from Indiana University, Bloomington.
