I am a PhD candidate in the History Department at Indiana University, the Digital Methods Specialist for IU's Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities, and a digital consultant for *The American Historical Review*. My research interests focus on the cultural economy of the U.S. in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. My dissertation project explores the evolving role of advertising in American society as a window into the development of capitalism in the postbellum period. I am also deeply involved in the digital humanities and incorporate GIS, network analysis, and coding in my work and research projects.
