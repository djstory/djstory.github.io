I am a historian and digital humanist. I serve as a Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In my work I support and collaborate with students and faculty who seek to engage digital methods in their teaching, research, or learning. My areas of expertise are digital mapping, audio recording/editing, and web exhibits, though I also dabble in data mining, network analysis, and some artisanal coding in Python and JavaScript. My main area of research is the history of data in American advertising, from the earliest days of the ad industry in the 1850s to the rise of the internet.

I hold a PhD in History from Indiana University, Bloomington, where I also earned a Graduate Certificate in Digital Arts and Humanities.

I currently serve in a consulting role as Podcast Editor for *The American Historical Review*.
