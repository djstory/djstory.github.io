I am a PhD candidate in the History Department at Indiana University and an editorial assistant at *The American Historical Review*. My research interests focus on the cultural economy of the U.S. in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. My dissertation project explores the evolving role of advertising in American society as a window into the development of capitalism in the postbellum period. I am also interested in the spatial history of the United States and the world, and I incorporate Historical GIS into various other research projects.
