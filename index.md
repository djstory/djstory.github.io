I am a historian and digital humanist. Beginning July 1, 2019, I will be Digital Scholarship Librarian at the Universiy of California, Santa Cruz as well as Podcast Editor for *The American Historical Review*. I hold a PhD in History from Indiana University, Bloomington. My interests focus on the cultural economy of the U.S. in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as well as the use of digital methods and tools in humanities scholarship. My dissertation explores how ad agents and publishers convinced a reluctant American business public to *believe* in advertising as a rational and effective economic tool. In part, it tells the story of the rise of data-driven advertising in the 1920s, a development with direct throughlines to present-day debates over consumer ad tracking and data privacy. My work regularly incorporates a range of digital approaches, including GIS, network analysis, and data mining.
