Tomorrow I'll be presenting my Barnum mapping project as part of the Digital Library Brown Bag Series at Indiana University. You can read about the session <a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/mapping-barnum-bailey-and-cody-american-entertainment-global-nineteenth-century" target="_blank">here</a>. And you can see my interactive map <a href="http://www.danieljstory.com/barnum" target="_blank">here</a>.

More to come.
