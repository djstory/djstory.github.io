### The Billposter’s Dream: Space, Spectacle, and the Meanings of Marginal Labor in America’s Long Gilded Age

This article is about billposters, not the advertising signs but the individuals who hung them. It examines their role as marginal labor in a similarly marginal outdoor advertising economy as it transitioned to the mainstream of American business. Looking at both billposters' experience as laborers and the ways their labor was taken into popular culture, I argue that billposters present an unexpectedly rich case for examining the different meanings of marginality, the ways it could be leveraged, and what happens when marginality is transformed.

It is currently in the review and revision process with a history academic journal.
