I am a PhD student in the Department of History at Indiana University and an editorial assistant at the American Historical Review. I hold a BA from Taylor University, an MTh from Bangor University, and an MA from the University of Chicago.

My research interests focus on the cultural economy of the U.S. in the nineteenth and early twentieth century with particular attention to the convergence of ideas, technology, and materiality. My current research focuses on the role that advertising played in nineteenth century America and how it evolved with the rise of industrialization and corporate capitalism. I am also interested in spatial history and digital mapping and have particular experience with ArcGIS, QGIS, and Carto. Among other things, I hope to apply these skills to questions of national growth and perceptions of “the nation” in nineteenth and early-twentieth-century America.

In 2016 I published the article “Consumer City” in Chicago History which explores the role of outdoor advertisers in debates over the shaping of Chicago’s built environment in the early twentieth century.

I currently have an article under review which explores the place of billposters as laborers in American society and popular imagination from the Civil War to the mid-twentieth century.
