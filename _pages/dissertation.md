### “Between Ourselves and the World: Advertising and the Rise of the New Corporate America”

My dissertation explores the ascent of advertisers to the role of expert mediators between business and the American public at the turn of the twentieth century, but I seek to recast this as a process more fraught with uncertainty. The rise to dominance of large corporations in these years has typically been framed as straightforwardly positive for the advertising industry, but in fact there were many at the time who thought just the opposite.

These advertising skeptics and dissenters comprised a diverse group ranging from business leaders to socialist activists and writers. What they held in common was the belief that the need to advertise was based primarily on economic competition and that as the economy grew more consolidated and coordinated this need would lessen—advertising, some thought, would soon be on the decline. In our world of TV ads, click-bate, and browser cookies, this seems almost laughable. But to advertisers at the time, the notion that their business might not be well-suited to the new corporate America was a serious challenge to overcome.

I am interested both in how advertisers responded to these specific critiques and how such uncertainties over advertisings’ future might help us reframe our understanding of more familiar developments in the industry in these years. The emergence of more multifaceted ad agencies, the growth of professional associations and trade journals, even the rise of the field of public relations all might be seen less as unbroken forward momentum and more as moments of redefinition and reinvention as advertisers adapted to fit a changed economic and social landscape. By focusing less on continuous growth and more on real and potential discontinuities, I hope to better understand how the modern advertising regime was born as well as to complicate its relationship with established narratives on the rise of mass consumer culture and the growth of corporate capitalism.
