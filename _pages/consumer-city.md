### Consumer City

My article in *Chicago History* is now available. It is titled “Consumer City” and explores outdoor advertisers in early-twentieth-century Chicago and their role in debates over the shape of the city’s public spaces and built environment. It argues that advertisers contributed a surprisingly nuanced view of the role of consumption in the city’s identity and partnered with an array of unexpected commercial and non-commercial actors to advance their vision and interests. I am especially excited about the number and quality of illustrations the magazine has included, many of which come straight from the archives at the Chicago History Museum.
