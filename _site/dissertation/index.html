<p>My dissertation enhances our understanding of the role of advertising in the history of American capitalism by looking beyond consumer culture alone to the evolving economic rationales that fueled advertising’s rise. My project examines the decades from the 1860s to the 1920s, the crucial period for the advertising industry’s formation, but instead of asking how advertising sold goods to consumers, I explore how publishers and advertising agents sold American business on advertising.</p>

<p>I put front and center the reality that throughout this period promoters of advertising had little direct evidence that advertising actually worked. Instead, they were forced to articulate conceptual arguments, and even a sort of capitalist mythology, about advertising that could commend it to a wary business public. Drawing from business records, advertising manuals, trade journals, newspapers, and manuscript collections, I lay out how in the middle decades of the nineteenth century publishers and ad agents forged a case for advertising as a respectable economic tool. But the small business, competitive economy in which these arguments took shape made them increasingly ill-fitting as businesses consolidated and large corporations emerged near the end of the century. In these years, a surprising mix of socialist and capitalist voices called advertising into question—-<em>if unrestrained competition gave birth to advertising, then combination and coordination would bring its decline</em>, they argued. Responding to this challenge were a range of prominent ad industry leaders together with a handful of visionary public relations pioneers who gradually resolved these tensions by fitting the modes and conceptions of advertising—how advertising was done and what function it was thought to serve—to the new landscape of corporate America.</p>

<p>This examination brings the discourse and arguments about advertising, and how these changed over time, into clearer focus, and by that offers a richer understanding of the role that advertising played in conceptions of American capitalism in this period of growth and change.</p>
